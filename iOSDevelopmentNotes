***MVC
Model: What your application is (not hoe it is displayed)
Controler: How the Model is to be displayed in the UI
View: The controller's minions

Controller ->Model, View are allowed
Model to View ->Never
View to Controller -> Restricted  Way..like an action,delegate,protocol(will,should,did), data source 
Model to Controller -> Notification & KVO. Broadcasts information.

Multiple MVCs can be working together.
